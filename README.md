# C++ and Antithesis SDK Overview

## 🚀 C++ Essentials for Interview

### 📌 Pointers and Memory Management

- **Definition**: A pointer stores the memory address of another variable.
- **Declaration**: `int* ptr;` (declares a pointer to an `int`).
- **Address-of Operator (`&`)**: `ptr = &x;` gets the memory address of `x`.
- **Dereferencing (`*`)**: `int value = *ptr;` accesses the value at a memory address.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:

  int\* p = new int(42);
  delete p; // Always free memory after allocation
  Pointer Arithmetic: (p + 1) moves the pointer to the next memory address.
  🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  Encapsulation: Use private members for data protection.
  Constructors: BankAccount(int initialBalance) : balance(initialBalance) {} initializes objects.
  Static Constants: static constexpr int MAX_BALANCE = 700; prevents magic numbers.
  Exception Handling: Prefer try-catch for error handling.
  🛠️ Antithesis C++ SDK Insights
  Antithesis SDK is used for deterministic testing, property-based testing, and instrumentation to detect edge cases, memory issues, and unexpected behaviors.

🔍 Key Antithesis SDK Concepts
Event Logging (send_event):

antithesis::send_event("event_name", antithesis::JSON{
{"key", value}
});
Used for tracking transactions, failures, or important program states.

Assertions:

ALWAYS(condition); → Ensures a condition is always true.
SOMETIMES(condition, "message", {{"key", value}}); → Detects rare occurrences.
Randomized Testing:

antithesis::randomInt(min, max); generates random values to test different paths.
✅ Code Analysis of BankAccount:
Potential Issues & Fixes
Edge Case Handling

Zero Deposits: Already handled (amount == 0).
Negative Withdrawals: Need explicit check (amount <= 0).
Percentage Calculation Error:

int percentage = (amount \* 100) / balance; // Possible division by zero
Fix: Ensure balance != 0 before division.
Integer Overflow Risks

balance + amount > MAX_BALANCE is correct, but ensure MAX_BALANCE isn't exceeded elsewhere.
Fix Missing Closing Parenthesis (withdraw function)

antithesis::send_event("withdrawal_successful", antithesis::JSON{
{"amount", amount},
{"balance", balance}
});
return true; // <- Closing brace was missing
Ensure the function has a proper return.

Identify inputs, outputs, and flow of logic.
Look at Antithesis instrumentation usage to ensure test coverage.
Modify Code with Testing in Mind:

Use antithesis::send_event to log unexpected cases.
Introduce edge-case handling (negative values, large inputs).
Debugging Strategy:

Use breakpoints or std::cout to track execution.
Look for memory issues: Are pointers being freed? Are values being modified unexpectedly?
Explain Your Thought Process Clearly:

When making a change, explain:
Why it’s needed
How it improves test coverage or code robustness
What risks it mitigates
